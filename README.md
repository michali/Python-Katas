Binary Expression Tree
----------------------
Develop code to allow a mathematical expression to be converted into a binary tree, which can then be evaluated to calculate the sum of the mathematical expression.

Write code that is unit tested that will:

1. Produce the tree nodes necessary to represent the binary tree
2. Use anonymous functions for the mathematical operations
3. Build a binary tree by parsing the string representing the formula in part A
4. Execute the operations and evaluate the tree by calling only the root tree node

Your code must work with the following:

 * 2+4+3  evaluates to 9
 * 2+4*3 evaluates to 14
 * 2/4*6 evaluates to 3
 * 2+4*3+5 evaluates to 19
 * 2+4*3-5 evaluates to 9
 * 3+4*5+7*3*5-9 evaluates to 119
 * 3+4*5+7*3*5-9/6*2+7 evaluates to 132
